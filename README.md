# NSAHackathon2025

Project overview: Nepali farmers often lack access to critical data that could significantly improve their harvests and crop health. Our project is designed to close this gap. We've created a new tool that uses speech-to-text technology and a direct integration with OpenAI. This allows farmers to simply let us know about how much land they have and what they are growing, and the software, in turn, provides them with personalized, data-driven advice.
